CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS â€“ LEVEL RED\#
TOP SECRET â€“ FOR AUTHORIZED EYES ONLY\#
Recovered from Capsule [Code: Omega-17]\#
---\#
Transmission Logs â€“ KRAKEN HQ and Unidentified Foreign Power\#
Date: [REDACTED]\#
From: KRAKEN Command, Director [REDACTED]\#
To: [Foreign Contact: Codename 'Spectre']\#
Subject: Trade Agreement â€“ Phase Two\#
---\#
'Spectre, we have delivered the requested intel on BLUFOR's naval movements. In exchange, we expect the next shipment of weapon systems to be ready by the next quarter. Ensure this transaction remains undiscovered. BLUFOR is beginning to suspect increased activity in the sector, but KRAKEN's role is still secure.'\#
---\#
Date: [REDACTED]\#
From: Spectre\#
To: KRAKEN Command\#
'Understood. Our latest technology will be delivered via the designated channels. As for your payment, the offshore accounts have been updated. Ensure your forces maintain distance during our next operation in BLUFOR waters. Any interference will result inâ€¦complications.'\#
---\#
Encrypted Audio File #0047 â€“ Recorded at KRAKEN HQ\#
Voice 1 (Director [REDACTED]): 'BLUFOR is getting too close to discovering our arrangement. We need to keep SEAWATCH and the others occupied with false threats. Divert their attention, leak false intel if you have to. Just make sure they don't figure out that we're the ones handing over BLUFOR's positions.'\#
Voice 2: 'And what about the space capsule? SEAWATCH might find out about the connection to Spectre.'\#
Voice 1: 'It doesn't matter. Once the sub is destroyed and the capsule's intel wiped, there will be no trace. If SEAWATCH gets too close, we'll deal with them just like we dealt with the others.'\#

Financial Transaction Report\#
Date: [REDACTED]\#
Transaction Type: Offshore Wire Transfer\#
From: KRAKEN HQ, Account [REDACTED]\#
To: [Foreign Power], Account [REDACTED]\#
Amount: $12,500,000 USD\#

Mission Brief â€“ KRAKEN HQ Internal\#
Date: [REDACTED]\#
'Operation â€˜Shroudâ€™ initiated. BLUFOR assets will be compromised during upcoming deployments. Our foreign partners will make their move once SEAWATCH is diverted. Ensure all evidence points away from KRAKEN's involvement. The longer we keep BLUFOR distracted, the more we can gain from this arrangement. Eliminate any potential leaks internally.'\#
